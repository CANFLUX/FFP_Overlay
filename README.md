# FFP Overlay

A wrapper for the [Kljun et al. 2015](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/8/3695/2015/gmd-8-3695-2015.html) flux footprint (FFP) function to incorporate spatial analysis in the FFP processing pipeline while parallelizing the processing to speed up computation times.

## Setup

For best results, you should use Python 3.10 or higher and run this code in a virtual environment

* Its is not explicitly required to use virtual environments, but it is good practice to ensure all dependencies are met and you don't corrupt your base Python installation
* The root folder "FFP_Overlay" has a "requirements.txt" which lists the packages installed in the virtual environment
    * To install the packages, you can follow the steps listed below
    * It is best to do this in a dedicated virtual environment so you don't run into any conflicts with pre-existing installations in your main python environment.
    * See the instructions below to create a generic virtual environment with pip
## Create a virtual environment

### Using Visual Studio (VS) Code

If you have VS Code installed, with the python extension, you can:

1. Open the FFP_Overlay folder in VS Code
2. Hit ctrl + shift + p > and select "Create Python Environment"
    * Use Venv, not conda
3. You will be prompted to select dependencies to install
    * Select "requirements.txt" form the menu.  This will automatically install all required packages for you.

### Windows setup

This assumes you have Biomet.Net in "C:\"

1. cd C:\FFP_Overlay\

2. py -m venv .venv

3. .\.venv\Scripts\activate

4. pip install -r .\requirements.txt

### macOS/Linux setup

This assumes you have Biomet.Net in "/home/"

1. cd /home/FFP_Overlay/

2. python3 -m venv .venv

3. source ./.venv/bin/activate

4. pip install -r ./requirements.txt
